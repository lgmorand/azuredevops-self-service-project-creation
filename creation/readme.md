# Creation of the project

As a second step, we need now to prepare the release (or releases), responsible to handle the creation of the project.

## Create a release

Once again, we are going to leverage Azure DevOps. So, in the "global" or "governance" project, create a (release) pipeline (/!\ not a build one. Not that it change anything but since it create something, I consider it a release, more than a build)

![Create release](./media/creating%201.png)

Then in the *variables* tab, add some variables like a the name of the project and its type.

> Don't forget to scroll to the right and check the variable to be settable at release creation

![Add variables](./media/creating%202.png)

You now have to add one powershell task in which we call call [Azure DevOps CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/cli/?view=azure-devops) commands

### Prepare the CLI

First we need to be sure that CLI is here (it should be present by default on Hosted Agents) and then, we need to ensure the azure-devops extension is also present (which should also be the base by default)

```powershell
az extension add --name azure-devops
```

Then we need to authenticate agains our organization. For that you have to create a PAT token, and add the value in the variables of your pipeline and click on the small lock, to make it a secret (secure). You can also use [Azure Keyvault integration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml).

```powershell
# setting up the PAT which will be used by commands
$env:AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT = '$(PAT)'

# authenticate against the desired org
az devops login --org "https://lgmorand.visualstudio.com/"
```

After that, it's time to create a project

```powershell
# create a new project
az devops project create --name $(ProjectName) --org "https://lgmorand.visualstudio.com/"

# set defaults so we don't have to repeat org and projects parameters for following commands
az devops configure --defaults organization=https://lgmorand.visualstudio.com/ project=$(ProjectName)
```

Then we want to customize the project, by creating a repo from a repo template (which you have to create yourself, it can be in Azure DevOps!), add some branching strategy, rights access and also create a first pipeline

Here is the full and final script:

```powershell
# Ensure that Azure DevOps CLI extension is installed
az extension add --name azure-devops

# setting up the PAT which will be used by commands
$env:AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT = '$(PAT)'

# authenticate against the desired org
az devops login --org "https://lgmorand.visualstudio.com/"

# create a new project
az devops project create --name $(ProjectName) --org "https://lgmorand.visualstudio.com/"

# set defaults so we don't have to repeat org and projects parameters for following commands
az devops configure --defaults organization=https://lgmorand.visualstudio.com/ project=$(ProjectName)

### Security ###
# retrieve the ID of the admin group of the new created project
$projectAdminGroup = az devops security group list --project test1 --query "graphGroups[?displayName=='Contributors'].descriptor" | Out-String

Write-Host $projectAdminGroup

# add the creator as the admin of the new created project
az devops security group membership add --group-id $projectAdminGroup --member-id '$(Creator)'

### Repository ###
# initialize the repository with a default content and retrieve the ID of the repo
$repositoryID = az repos import create --repository $(ProjectName) --git-source-url "https://github.com/lgmorand/azuredevops-defaultrepo" --query repository.id -o json | Out-String

# branch policy on master => enforce workitem linking
az repos policy work-item-linking create --blocking true --enabled true --branch master --repository $repositoryID

# branch policy on master => enforce comment resolution
az repos policy comment-required create --blocking true --enabled true --branch master --repository $repositoryID

# branch policy on master => enforce code reviewing
az repos policy approver-count create --blocking true --enabled true --allow-downvotes false --reset-on-source-push false --minimum-approver-count 1 --creator-vote-counts true --branch master --repository $repositoryID

```

When executed you get:

- a new project is created
- for which the new admin is the creator of the *Demand* ticket
- a repo is already present
- best practices for branching strategy are also in place

It's not perfect but that's a pretty good start for a scaffolded project isn't it ?

## Next steps

It's now time to [process our tickets](../processing/readme.md).
